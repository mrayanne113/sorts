# Sorting Suite

## Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort

### Learning Goals 
* Come to recognize how you solve problems
* Come to trust and rely on your classmates
* Learn to wrestle with a difficult problem instead of waiting for someone else to show you the answer
* Practice articulating code
* Learn to think algorithmically
* Begin to understand optimization and efficiency
* Learn to write (and love) unit tests

### To Complete is this Project
* Show my understanding of each sort with a deck of cards
* I had to be able to pseudocode or whiteboard during the eval on any given sort
* Have a fully tested suite that pushed my computer to the limit before the test timed out
